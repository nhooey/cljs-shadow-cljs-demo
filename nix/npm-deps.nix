{ buildNpmPackage, src, ... }: # Removed lib and fetchNpmDeps as they are not needed for hashing here

# This package defines the Node.js dependencies for shadow-cljs.
# It expects src to be passed, which should point to the directory
# containing package.json and package-lock.json.
buildNpmPackage rec {
  pname = "shadow-cljs-npm-deps";
  version = "0.1.0"; # Can be aligned with your project version

  # The source of your project, where package.json and package-lock.json reside
  inherit src;

  # buildNpmPackage automatically handles the hashing of package-lock.json
  # when 'src' is provided and contains package-lock.json.
  # Therefore, 'npmDepsHash' should NOT be explicitly set here.

  # The default install phase of buildNpmPackage places node_modules directly.
  # This custom installPhase is only if you need a non-standard structure.
  # For typical use, you might even be able to remove this entire installPhase
  # if buildNpmPackage's default output suits your needs.
